# JSDG : Simple Generate Sample Data
## Overview
GSDG is a lightweight utility project designed to help developers easily generate sample and test data when building personal or prototype applications.

In many cases, developers struggle to find realistic data for testing or showcasing their projects. DataGenerator solves this problem by creating structured and randomized data that follows a user-defined JSON format.

With just a few lines of setup, you can fill your APIs, databases, or UI components with believable mock data â€” making your project look more complete, polished, and ready for presentation.
